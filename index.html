            Hi I am Gray and this is how being chronically ill influences me. Being chronically ill can be very uncomfortable 
            and scary so I want to share my expierence of what my body has taught me. I have been sick for a long time and I have
            learned to listen to my body and take care of myself. I have also learned to be patient with myself and to not push 
            myself too hard. I have learned to ask for help when I need it and to not be afraid to say no. I have learned to 
            appreciate the little things in life and to find joy in the small moments. I have learned that being sick does not 
            define me and that I am still capable of living a full and meaningful life.
        </p>
