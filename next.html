    <p>I have been sick for a long time and I have learned to listen to my body and take care of myself. I have also learned to be patient with myself and to not push 
    myself too hard. I have learned to ask for help when I need it and to not be afraid to say no. I have learned to 
    appreciate the little things in life and to find joy in the small moments. I have learned that being sick does not 
    define me and that I am still capable of living a full and meaningful life.</p>
