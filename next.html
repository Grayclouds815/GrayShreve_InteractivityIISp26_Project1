    <p>I have learned to be more empathetic and understanding towards others who are going through difficult
     times. I have learned to be more resilient and to not give up easily. I have learned to find joy in the 
     small things in life and to appreciate the beauty around me. I have learned to be more creative and to 
     find new ways to express myself. I have learned that being sick does not define me and that I am still 
     capable of living a full and meaningful life..</p>
